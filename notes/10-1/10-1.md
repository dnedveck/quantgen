## Coancestry

fig 5.1 pedigree 

inbreeding coefficient $F_X$ is equal to coancestry $f_{P,Q} = probability of sampling one allele from P and one from Q, and that they are both the same allele.

$$ 
f_{P,Q} = 1/2 (f_{B,Q} + f_{A,Q})
$$


The coancestry of an individual with itself is 1/2.


--- Did a bunch of pedigree stuff

## Resemblance between relatives 

With respect to a qunatitative trait.
We measure this with th covariance

$$
Covariance = E \left[(X-\mu)(Y-\mu)  \right]
$$ 

covar(X,X) = var(X) $\ge$ 0
