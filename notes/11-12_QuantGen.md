11-12 Quant Gen
========================================================

Correlated Characters: measuring one trait that cna act as a proxy for another. Ease of measuring one, or time of measuring one compared to a more difficult or later trait.


Genetic causes for correlated traits is pleiotropy and linkage disequilibrium. 

Pleiotropy: one gene affects mutliple traits
Epistasis: expression of one gene depends on expression of other genes. 



heritability, $h^2$, can range from $0 \le h^2 \le 1$. Covariances range from -1 to 1. 

in the text: estimation of genetic covariances

$Cov(X,Y) = rV_A + u+V_D$, where $u$ is the probability that an allele is IBD, and $r$ 2 times the coefficient of conancestry between the two individuals.


### Sib Analysis

sires each mated to multiple dams.
Looking at variance of one trait - ANOVA
Looking at covariance of traits - ANCOVA
Looking at the variance present in muliple traits - MANOVA

Then there's matrix partitioned business - looking at the design and observational components (sigma s, d, and w), $\sigma^2_S$ is the variance of a single trait in the sires. 

$\sigma_S(Z_1,Z_2)$ notation is the covariance of two traits in the sires 
$$
\frac{1}{4} cov_A(Z_1, Z_2)
$$

### Respose to selection

$CR_Y$ is the correlated response to selection in trait Y, when selection is acting on trait X. $CR$ stands for correlated response, it's one term, not $C \times R$




R. Lande generalized the 

$$
\Delta \bar{z}_1 = GP^{-1}S
$$
$\Delta \bar{z}_1$ = vector  
$G$ = additive genotype var-cov matrix  
$P^{-1}$ = inverse of the phenotypic variance  
$S$ = selection differential, as a vector
