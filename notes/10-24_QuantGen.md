Interplay between selection and drift 

### Modes of selection on a qunatitative trait.

#### Directional Selection

truncation selection (only selecting after a certain trait value) is the most common form of artificial selection

stabilizing selection - selection pressure for trait to be in the middle of the trait

disruptive selection - fitness greatest for either extreme of the trait, and lowest for middle values of the trait. 


selection intensity:
$$
i = S / \sigma_p = S / \sqrt{V_P}
$$
