------------------------------------------------

talking about variaton due to differences in the environment  
 V_Eg - general environmental variance  
 V_Es - variation withing individuals with respect to the quantitative trait.  
 V_Ec   

P = G + E_micro  
var(P) = var(G) + var(E) + 2cov(G,E)  

If we assume that the covariance of the G and E is zero we can then begin to work on estimating the variance of the G. 

### GxE interaction

This can be shown in the classic reaction norm plot. 

GxE norm of reaction is also called the genotypic plasticity. 

No GxE, then all the genotypes have the same slope (parallel) when going from environment to environment. There is a GxE interaction when there are differeing slopes for the genotypes going from environment to environment. 

GxE involves gene expression contigent on particular environments. 

### Population Genetics

Relaxing the assumtion of an infinite population, therefore finite N, and drift occurs. 

This finite population size and drift is a stochastic theory/process. Probablistic approaches to determinine gene frequencies from generation to generation.

We can't really predict the allele frequencies, but we can look at the variances of the allele frequencies. If p=1, or q=1, then the variance will be the smallest, but if p=0.5 and q=0.5, then the variance will be the highest.

$$
\sigma_p^2 = \frac{p_o q_o}{2N}
$$ 

for those of you familiar with ... this equation is the binomial distribution (or the variance for a binomial distribution? similar to?).

Allele frequency at any time t is;
$$
\sigma_p^2 = p_o q_o [1 - (1- \frac{1}{2N})^t]
$$
Using this equation, t = generations, and then as N gets larger, the quantity in parentheses gets closer to 1, and then the variance approaches 0.

What's the effect of drift on genetic variance among populations? It increases the variance anong populations, they are becoming more and more different from each other. Divergence among the populations, but each population becomes more similar. Happens faster the smaller the population size. 

Drift also reduces genetic variation within populations. 
 * if the allele becomes fixed, then all subsequent generations will not have the other allele. After a ton of generations, we expect them to eventually fix for certain alleles. probability of fixation of a particular allele is equal to it's starting frequency.  
 
genetic variance is reduced to $1/2 V_{g_o}$ in ~1.4N generations
