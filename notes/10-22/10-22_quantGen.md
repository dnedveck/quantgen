10-22 Quant Gen
========================================================

this session, reintroduce evolutionary processes
- drift 
- inbreeding
- migration
- mutation
- selection


### Migration
a better term for this is *Gene Flow* or *dispersal*.

Usually we're thinking abou isolated populations, but now we're considering populations that are connected via migration.

Isolation of populations by drift, and the homoginization by drift
 - see expression 2.2 in the text
 
$$
\Delta q = m (q_s - q_r)
$$


change in allele frequency is equal to $m$, number of immigrants divided by the pop size $N$, $q_s$ is the allele frequency in the source of immigrants population, and $q_r$ is the allele frequency in the recipient population.

### Mutation

$\mu$ is rate of mutation, $\nu$ is rate of reverse mutation

$10^{-9}$ bp/gen could be considered a background level mutation rate, or $10^{-6}$ gene/gen (functional locus/gene).


Mutation- ultimate source of all genetic variation. Mutations: alleleic variants.


### Selection 

Abosulte fitness of allele combinations (1 and 2):
$$
W_{11}, W_{12}, W_{22}
$$
Absolute fitness is how many young are part of the next generation.

But a lot of pop gen theory focus of viability (surviving to reproduce), as opposed to number of young production. 

Relative fitness, $w$
