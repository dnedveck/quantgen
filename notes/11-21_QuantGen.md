Inbreeding and change of means of a population

Trait mean in inbreeding ($M_F$) - trait mean in random mating ($M_{F=0}$)

Effect of inbreeding on trait mean:
$$
M_F - M_{F=0} \\
a(p-q) + 2pqd - 2pqFd = M_F
$$

There is only inbreeding effects when $F > 0$ and $|d| > 0$. When there is dominance, and inbreeding. Also, $p$ or $q$ can't be zero, there has to be segregating variation at the locus.

If there is no epistatsis, the effect of inbreeding is:
$$
- 2 F \sum_{i=1}^{nloci} p_iq_id_i
$$
summing over allele freqs and dominance parameter at each loci
