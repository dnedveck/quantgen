What's coefficeint of variation?
generally defined:
$$
\frac{\sqrt{Var}}{\bar{X}}
$$
It determines if a property is highly variable or not. Used to compare variance of one trait to another, either in the same organism, or across organisms. This is a dimesionless number that reflects the variance scaled to the mean.

also:
$$
\frac{\sqrt{V_A}}{\bar{X}}
$$
Standardizd measure of the additive genetic variance. Also a dimensionless number. One element to use this is, to observe change in the trait proportional to the mean, as opposed to the absolute change of the mean ($R=h^2S$). 



cov(individuals within a group) / cov(a random individual) = variance among the means of the groups.
- in the chapter with the nested sib analysis stuff


cov() is a measure of linear association between traits
