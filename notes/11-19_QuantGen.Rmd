========================================================


$\sigma^2_{SXe}\rightarrow$ G X E interaction die to the change in breeding values

we have a GxE interaction any time we have a nonparallelism in the reaction norms
 - change in rank of different Genotypes fitness in different environments
 - or same rank, just wider differences between the groups
 
one can also use $r_g$, the correlation of trait in E1, with trait in E2. Trait measured in two different environments. This is the genetic correlation between traits in different environments
