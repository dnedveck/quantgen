10-29 Quant Gen
========================================================

## Repeatabilitiy of response
- attaching se to measures of heritability


## asymmetry of response
- upward vs downward selection could have different heritability / repsonse to selection


## Group work, reasons for asymmetry in selection

### Maternal effects
- maternal effects can be predicted once they are known, but they must be worked with on a case by case basis. 
- maternal effects can decrease selection responses in one direction, while not inhibiting responses in the other 

Example of mice
- selected for large litters
- large litter resulted on mice having to share milk, reducing their adult size
- smaller mice had smaller litters, which then resulted in a decreased response to selection
